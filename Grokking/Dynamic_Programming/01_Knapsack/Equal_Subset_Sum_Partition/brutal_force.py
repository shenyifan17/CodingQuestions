Problem Statement #
Given a set of positive numbers, 
find if we can partition it into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both the subsets is equal.

Example 1: #
Input: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: True
Explanation: The given set can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum: {1, 4} & {2, 3}
Example 2: #
Input: {1, 1, 3, 4, 7}
Output: True
Explanation: The given set can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum: {1, 3, 4} & {1, 7}
Example 3: #
Input: {2, 3, 4, 6}
Output: False
Explanation: The given set cannot be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum.


this problem follows the 01_knapsack pattern

Assume if S represents the total sum of all the given numbers, 
then the two equal subsets must have a sum equal to S/2.
This essentially transforms our problem to: 
"Find a subset of the given numbers that has a total sum of S/2".

So our brute-force algorithm will look like:

for each number 'i' 
  create a new set which INCLUDES number 'i' if it does not exceed 'S/2', and recursively 
      process the remaining numbers
  create a new set WITHOUT number 'i', and recursively process the remaining items 
return true if any of the above sets has a sum equal to 'S/2', otherwise return false
